# Ephemeral E-Signature Protocols

A collection of three innovative models designed to enhance electronic signature (**e-signature**) security, addressing recent e-signature scandals with a blend of user control, legal compliance, and both flexibility and usability for public services.

---

## Overview

The repository presents three interrelated models:

1. **One-Time Temporary Key Model (via e-Government)**
2. **Docker-Based Ephemeral E-Signature Protocol**
3. **Hybrid Model (combining Docker + e-Government)**

Each architecture aims to mitigate permanent private key exposure and strengthen trust in e-signature processes.

## 1. One-Time Temporary Key Model (Managed by e-Government)

### Summary  
This model eliminates the risk of long-term private key storage. It introduces a one-time "approval key" generated by the e-Government, acting like a temporary private key, with automatic expiration to minimize attack surface.

### Components & Flow

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **e-Government Server** | Authenticates user, generates and eventually destroys temporary key pair. |
| **BTK (Regulator)** | Issues a user-specific 30-second token; acts as a bridge authority. |
| **E-Signature Provider (CA)** | Generates certificate using CSR model; signs via HSM. |
| **User Device** | Web or mobile interface with optional two-factor authentication. |

**Process:**
1. User logs into e-Government and initiates signature.
2. e-Government requests a token from BTK; BTK issues a 30-second token used by both the e-Government and CA.
3. e-Government generates a temporary approval/public key pair; this key is valid only once.
4. The public key, identity data, and token are sent to the CA via BTK.
5. The CA issues the certificate, encrypts it using the user's public key, and returns it to BTK.
6. e-Government decrypts, verifies with the temporary key, then delivers certificate to the user.

### Advantages
- Eliminates long-term key leakage.
- No permanent data retained.
- Two-factor verification prevents unauthorized use.
- Auto-expiring key; no need for revocation.

## 2. Docker-Based Ephemeral E-Signature Protocol

### Summary  
This model addresses usability and centralization concerns by generating ephemeral key pairs inside user-controlled Docker containers, which are destroyed post-use.

### Components & Flow

- **User Device (Docker Container):** Generates transient key pair securely and locally.
- **BTK:** Issues time-stamped tokens for validation.
- **E-Signature Provider:** Uses token to validate source and issue certificates.
- **Process Flow:**
  1. User requests signature via e-Government.
  2. e-Government fetches token from BTK and passes it to the user’s Docker container.
  3. Container generates key pair, sends public key, identity, and token to BTK → CA.
  4. CA issues the certificate, encrypts it with the public key.
  5. Certificate is sent back to the container, cryptographically signed.
  6. Container performs the signature operation.
  7. After signing, the container and all keys are irreversibly destroyed.

### Advantages
- Removes central server vulnerabilities.
- No reliance on physical tokens.
- Aligns with legal standards: user retains sole access to private keys.

---

## 3. Hybrid Model (Docker + e-Government)

### Summary  
Combines the strengths of both models: centralized token management and on-device signing for enhanced security and usability.

### Key Features
- Initiate process via e-Government (centralized simplicity).
- Carry out signing within Docker container (security + user control).
- Allow users to optionally use existing private keys.
- Increased flexibility and stronger legal alignment.

##  Comparison Table

| Feature | Docker Model | e-Government Model | Hybrid Model |
|---------|--------------|--------------------|--------------|
| Key Generation | On user device (Docker) | Centralized (e-Government) | Docker or user’s existing key |
| User Control | Full | None | Full / Partial |
| Security | Very High | Medium–Low | High |
| Usability | Technical setup required | Very Easy | Moderate |
| Legal Compliance | Full | Low | High |
| Centralized Risk | None | High | Reduced |
| Physical Device Requirement | None | None | Optional |

---

##  Recommendations

- **Security-critical applications:** Use the Docker model.
- **Ease of use priority:** e-Government model may be acceptable with legal caveats.
- **Balanced, future-proof approach:** Adopt the Hybrid model—ideal for pilot programs combining usability, trust, and security.
