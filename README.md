# Ephemeral E-Signature Framework

A collection of three innovative models designed to **eliminate permanent private key risks** in electronic signature (e-signature) systems, addressing recent security scandals with a blend of **user control**, **legal compliance**, and **public service usability**.

Even if a key is intercepted by an attacker, it is **valid for only one signing operation** and becomes useless immediately afterward — removing the need for revocation and preventing large-scale leaks.

## Overview

This repository presents three interrelated models:

1. **One-Time Temporary Key Model** (via e-Government)
2. **Docker-Based Ephemeral E-Signature Protocol**
3. **Hybrid Model** (combining Docker + e-Government)

Each architecture aims to:
- Mitigate permanent private key exposure.
- Strengthen public trust in e-signature processes.
- Ensure compliance with **eIDAS** and **Turkish Law 5070**.

## 1. One-Time Temporary Key Model (Managed by e-Government)

**Summary**  
This model eliminates the risk of long-term private key storage by introducing a one-time "approval key" generated by the e-Government. This temporary private key automatically expires after use, minimizing the attack surface.

**Components & Flow**

| Component              | Role |
|------------------------|------|
| e-Government Server    | Authenticates user, generates & destroys temporary key pair. |
| BTK (Regulator)        | Issues a user-specific 30-second token; acts as a bridge authority. |
| E-Signature Provider   | Generates certificate via CSR; signs using HSM. |
| User Device            | Web or mobile interface; supports two-factor authentication. |

**Process**
1. User logs into e-Government and initiates signature.
2. e-Government requests a token from BTK; BTK issues a 30-second token.
3. e-Government generates a one-time approval/public key pair.
4. Public key + identity + token sent to CA via BTK.
5. CA issues the certificate, encrypts with user’s public key, returns to BTK.
6. e-Government decrypts, verifies, and delivers to user.

**Advantages**
- No permanent key storage.
- Auto-expiring keys; interception yields no value.
- Two-factor verification prevents unauthorized use.
- No need for revocation lists.

## 2. Docker-Based Ephemeral E-Signature Protocol

**Summary**  
Generates ephemeral key pairs inside a **user-controlled Docker container** that is destroyed after signing. This gives the user **exclusive control** over private keys.

**Components & Flow**
- **User Device (Docker)**: Generates transient key pair locally.
- **BTK**: Issues time-stamped tokens.
- **E-Signature Provider (CA)**: Issues certificate after validation.

**Process**
1. User requests signature via e-Government.
2. e-Government fetches token from BTK and sends to Docker container.
3. Container generates ephemeral key pair.
4. Public key + identity + token → BTK → CA.
5. CA issues certificate, encrypts with public key, returns to container.
6. Container signs the document.
7. Container & keys are **irreversibly destroyed**.

**Advantages**
- Full user control; no central server stores private keys.
- Legal compliance with strong authentication standards.
- Intercepted keys expire immediately after use.

---

## 3. Hybrid Model (Docker + e-Government)

**Summary**  
Combines centralized convenience with decentralized security.  
Tokens & identity management happen via e-Government, while signing occurs locally in a Docker container.

**Key Features**
- Centralized simplicity for identity management.
- Local, user-controlled signing.
- Optional use of existing private keys.
- Balanced approach for both usability & security.

## Comparison Table

| Feature                 | Docker Model | e-Government Model | Hybrid Model |
|-------------------------|--------------|--------------------|--------------|
| Key Generation          | Local (Docker) | Centralized | Docker or user’s key |
| User Control            | Full | None | Full / Partial |
| Security                | Very High | Medium–Low | High |
| Usability               | Requires setup | Very Easy | Moderate |
| Legal Compliance        | Full | Low | High |
| Centralized Risk        | None | High | Reduced |
| Physical Device Required| None | None | Optional |

---

## Security Guarantee

> **Even if an attacker gains access to the ephemeral private key,  
> it becomes useless immediately after the signing operation.**

This is enforced through:
- Automatic key destruction after use.
- Very short validity period (seconds or minutes).
- No persistent private key storage.

---

## Recommendations

- **Maximum security needs:** Docker model.
- **Ease-of-use priority:** e-Government model (with legal caveats).
- **Balanced approach:** Hybrid model — ideal for pilot programs.
